                            Hi! My name is Corey. I am a student of the coding bootcamp at Codecademy. 
                            I am currently learning full stack web development and so, I decided to make a project portfolio. 
                            I am hoping to gain more experience for a job in the tech industry and made this page to showcase my skills.   
                            Even though I have only started learning to code and web development, I am excited to learn more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I, most recently, worked construction for the last 9 years. I mainly did carpentry work.
                            I love to build things but don't want to destroy my body like so many others do in construction.
                            My main true passion is computers and technology and thought i'll take my love to build and apply 
                            it to something in the tech industry. Thats when i decided to persue a career in full stack web development.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My other interests in tech are Cybersecurity and Software Development. I have always been fascinated with hacking
                            and the different techniques. One of the reasons I started coding was to learn how to read it better and better my
                            skills as an ethical hacker. Now, learning how to secure code has become fascinating to me also. 
                        </p>

                                A browser based game where you guess which major public figure who said the quote.
                                You test yourself to see how high you can score. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
                                and ran completely through the browser. Its still a work in progress. I have to finish
                                more of the different categories and put together a highscore table. I built it for the 
                                browser with the idea I could expand on it and host it online. Eventually, implement an online 
                                live multiplayer mode possibly. Maybe even convert it to a mobile app to enjoy from the phone on 
                                the go.

                                This was a mock-up webpage created for a friends business he is trying to get started.
                                He told me he wants to start up his own company but just didnt have enough clients to keep it consistant.
                                Since I was already learning web devlopment, I told him I could make him up a little webpage so 
                                he would have something he can point people to or put out to people. I told him I can use the practice 
                                so Id do it for free. He agreed, cause why not, and this is what I came up with.

                                This is a web app that uses the OMDB API to allow users to find information about different movies.
                                Its a very simple app with a very simple UI but, I created this app to showcase my skills at interacting 
                                with an API. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
